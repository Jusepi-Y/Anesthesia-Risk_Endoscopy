- Project Description:
  
The Anesthesia Risk Prediction Web Application is a tool for healthcare professionals to assess anesthesia-related risks in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures using propofol.
 It leverages a logistic regression model for predictions.
- Project Approach:
  
 The approach involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, model development and evaluation, serialization, and creation of a Streamlit web application for user interaction.
-Insights & Data Visualization:

 Insights from EDA include the distribution of key variables like age, weight, ASA score, and risk label.
 Correlation analysis identified positive and negative correlations with the risk label.

- ML Model Accuracy:
  
 The logistic regression model showed an accuracy of 85.94%, precision of 91.30%, recall of 75.00%, F1 score of 82.35%, and ROC-AUC score of 84.72%, indicating a well-performing model for predicting high-risk cases.

-IMPACT AND BENEFITS

The integration of educational resources and feature contribution visualization into the Anesthesia Risk Prediction Web Application provides several benefits:

✓ Enhanced Decision Support:

By offering immediate access to relevant information and insights into the model's decisionmaking process, the app supports healthcare professionals in making informed decisions
regarding patient care.

✓ Educational Value:

The inclusion of ASA resources serves an educational purpose, ensuring that users have access to reliable information on anesthesia risks and specific procedures.

✓ Increased Transparency and Trust:

The feature contribution graph increases the transparency of the model's predictions, fostering trust in the tool's utility and accuracy.
