- Project Description: 

The Anesthesia Risk Prediction Web Application is a tool for healthcare professionals to assess anesthesia-related risks in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures using propofol.
 It leverages a logistic regression model for predictions.
- Project Approach:

 The approach involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, model development and evaluation, serialization,
 and creation of a Streamlit web application for user interaction.
 
-Insights & Data Visualization:

 Insights from EDA include the distribution of key variables like age, weight, ASA score, and risk label.
 Correlation analysis identified positive and negative correlations with the risk label. 
 
Feature importance was visualized using a bar chart.


- ML Model Accuracy:
 The logistic regression model showed an accuracy of 85.94%, precision of 91.30%, recall of 75.00%, F1 score of 82.35%, and ROC-AUC score of 84.72%, indicating a well-performing model for predicting high-risk cases.
